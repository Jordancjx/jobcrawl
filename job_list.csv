DevOps Engineer (AIR Lab),Full-time,Singapore (On-site),Canonical,"Location: Singapore, Singapore

Thales people architect solutions that are relied upon to deliver operational advantage at every decisive moment throughout the mission. Defence and armed forces customers rely on us to deliver the full range of defensive systems for land, sea, and air. From early warning, to threat neutralisation, our platforms cover all levels from very short-range systems, to extended protection across the entire battle-space including Airspace Mobility Solutions, Vehicles and Tactical Systems and Missile Defence, Optronics, and Radar.

Thales established its presence in Singapore in 1973 to support the expansion of aerospace-related activities in the Asia-Pacific region. Throughout the last four decades, the company grew from strength to strength and is today involved in the primary businesses of Aerospace (including Air Traffic Management), Defence & Security, Ground Transportation and Digital Identity & Security. Thales today employs over 2,100 people in Singapore across all its business areas.

The Aviation Innovation Research (AIR) Lab

The joint CAAS-Thales innovation lab known as ‘AIR Lab’ started to operate on 1st November 2019 with the objective to develop Proof of Concepts (POCs) or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) of advanced and open technologies for future Air Traffic Management (ATM). Currently, the joint lab employs a team of 40 Thales engineers and 12 CAAS engineers and air traffic controllers operating in a vibrant ecosystem involving a number of Singaporean SMEs and start-ups, as well as key research institutes.

Thales engineers include 10 domain experts – with more than 10 years of experience – coming from Thales ATM centres of competence in France and Australia. These experts are coaching both the local Thales and CAAS engineers.

The POCs and MVPs are co-developed with the CAAS engineers who have access to the same development tools and environment used by the Thales Engineers (provided by the Singapore branch of Thales Digital Factory).

Senior Full-stack Software Engineer,Full-time · Mid-Senior level,"Singapore, Singapore (Hybrid)",HMI Group,"Hello, we’re Knoetic (<-rhymes with “poetic” 😊)!

We've raised over $50MM from Accel, EQT Ventures, Menlo, and 100s of angels (like Adam Grant). 

Why did these world-class VCs and angels want in on Knoetic? 

Because we’re building a “brain” for Chief People Officers that enables them to build healthy, productive, equitable workforces – and ultimately shapes the future of work. 

How does it work?
  The “left brain” is Knoetic Analytics – the quantitative insights. We integrate with HR systems (HRIS, recruiting platforms, performance platforms, etc), ingest all that disparate employee data, manipulate it via a complex transform process, and then push insights back to the customer in a user-friendly way. Chief People Officers use Knoetic Analytics to visualize their workforce, prepare for Board meetings, influence their executive team, workforce plan, uncover performance trends, and much more. 
The “right brain” is CPOHQ – the qualitative insights. Chief People Officers join our executive community to tap the wisdom of their peers, find best practices, workshop pressing business challenges, and make meaningful connections. The role of the CPO has never been more complex, and CPOHQ is where they turn to inform the decisions that impact their employees. 

By bringing Analytics & CPOHQ together, we give CPOs and their People teams a holistic view of what drives employees to come, stay, and feel valued at work. This is a platform unlike any other.

That’s where you come in!

We’re building a diverse team of Knoeticons who can thrive in our culture. If you're motivated to improve the work lives of millions of people as part of an ambitious and collaborative team, we'd love for you to join us on this ride :) 

About The Role
We are building out our founding Engineering team. Senior Full-stack Engineers have the opportunity to work across the stack, front to back. You’ll take ideas from inception to reality by rapidly building prototypes, iterating, and releasing them. You’ll build scalable products that make the people analytics experience for People leaders and organizations more insightful and more efficient.

The base salary range for this role, adjusted for level, is between 120,000 SGD - 150,000 SGD in Singapore. When determining a candidate’s compensation, we consider a number of factors including level, skillset, experience, job scope, location, and current market data. This range is not inclusive of our competitive equity package. There are also opportunities to travel to the US, particularly New York City during our annual company onsite, or department on-sites.

Overall you will:
Produce high-quality, production-ready, readable, maintainable code
Lead large projects from initial inception to production
Collaborate with leadership and with peers across engineering, design, product, and go-to-market
Build beautiful, scalable solutions to make the people Analytics experience for CPOs, people leaders, and entire organizations 100x more efficient

Within your first week, you will:
Onboard and learn more about the company’s mission, culture, and values. You’ll write a user manual and a Professional Development Plan outlining exactly how you want to grow professionally over the next 1-2 years.
Understand Knoetic's tech infrastructure in-depth. We will pair you up with a peer to help you get up to speed.
Deploy your first Pull Request to production

Within your first month, you will:
Collaborate with the team which includes our product manager and product designer to deliver a low/medium-sized project
Participate in road mapping and architecture discussions
Pair program with talented, ambitious engineers within a highly-collaborative team

At three months, you'll be fully ramped! You will: 
Lead a complex project from inception to deployment that will immediately provide value to our users
Identify, evaluate, and define improvements to the existing infrastructure and product

What we’re looking for
BS degree in Computer Science or equivalent practical experience
4+ years of experience building modern web applications using Javascript frameworks like ReactJS or similar, and with backend programming languages like NodeJS, Python, or similar
Demonstrated comfort building applications using our backend tech stack (Go, AWS, Kubernetes, SQL, NodeJS)
You pride yourself on being able to identify and address issues before they become problems, and are skilled at finding signals in the noise

If this sounds like an amazing opportunity for you, apply now, and let's shape the future of work together!

 The key attributes we value in teammates:
You like to win. You run through walls to achieve your goals, and you don't settle for participation trophies.
You're intellectually curious, and intellectually humble. You approach problems with intellectual rigor, and with an open mind and ear. You’re not afraid to say, “I don’t know - but I’ll figure it out, fast.”
You never say, “that’s not my job” - you take full ownership and responsibility over outcomes. You’re a force of nature that gets the job done no matter what it takes.
You make everyone else on the team better. Your presence, positivity, and drive inspire others to step up their game. You put the company above your own wants.
You’re known for your work ethic. You pride yourself on being one of the hardest-working person most people know.
You’re constantly improving. You know there’s no such thing as perfection, and you’re always pushing yourself (and our company) to be better than you were yesterday.
You’re confident that you are good, and humble to know you can be better: You’re honest, principled, smart, open to giving/receiving feedback, and focused on doing right for the company and doing right for the customer","Posted on Jul 24, 2023.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3717726482/?eBP=CwEAAAGK-O139xEigdei-ail0RVkm_XPxOA6t_Msn5PfS6j-3gJHB9m83HgJEu8FgQOwHLng_oqUrslHavelEqg55Z_YDLkp61O8Aw9_xKhgClp21ooJjTFW2lfRyX3rDMplfE7CBccQPRBHPijOWcR4vjgq-9XNyC2LgINxHCCOZ94ryVcK5cLIkHd4FSNsmyp6Zr8PKlV79wR5_NPRFbMBDCx1jxEsymiZM6ak_9eAHnEAIJjiJGO4D7oCGOqtRQUUE2CU-Pb2lSSo6KQBsi1SzeWOB4P6McHrQPmgoAdL9Q1WLDbBt6-GkrtRZUucYewwskz5X-BZx1ifYHq28aun3rl7AM9_fEKnzSkRdYDuLOO2ze3RAP9c9-6UCH6YbCK3KfHR&refId=pMnsiCFgQPVCYIwor7AemA%3D%3D&trackingId=wWkgBB21ITcrO1mV5jLPPQ%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_search_srp_jobs

Firmware Development Engineering – Enterprise SIE Test Development Team is located in Seagate Singapore Design Centre at One-North. The team design, develop and maintain test software in C/C++/Python under Linux/Windows for validating the firmware features in Seagate’s leading-edge Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD). Before a new firmware can be populated to tens and thousands of HDD/SSD in the production, it needs to pass the system integration test verification and validation. We develop and maintain the test software suite in C/C++/Python, as well as software toolkits in Python/Bash. We also develop Linux open-source device driver and customize the installation modules for Seagate internal users. We need to study various features specifications and industry standards of HDD/SSD, including SATA/SAS/NVMe/PCIe, design or enhance the test scenarios, write unit tests to debug the software and firmware, conduct various experiments and failure analysis, and review the solutions with other developers locally or in US. The work in the team is critical to the firmware quality of HDD/SSD. 

About The Role - You Will

Develop a new software tool in Python/C/C++ to help solve the common problems that test software developers frequently encounter. For example, it’s a time-consuming process for developers to find out what calling functions/modules/files have been impacted by the changes made to the library supporting functions. Your tool will need to scan through around 500k lines of C/C++ test source code, analyze the call stack and output a list of file names and modules that have direct or indirect impact by the change in the library functions. And the list of impacted programs/modules will then be compiled and executed automatically. 
Develop and update test software to meet the new test requirement. 
Study the Industry Standard SCSI command specs, HDD SMART specs and Seagate specific feature specs 
Study existing test software, design or modify the test scenarios to meet the new test requirement
Write unit test, bench test, debug and conduct experiment to validate the software and firmware 
Conduct code review with other software developers. 
Conduct FA and fix the issues in the test software
You will be trained to understand various command specs and the essential test software functions to communicate with the HDD
You will follow Software Development Life Cycle process, applying Agile/Scrum methodology, to design and release the software. 

About You

Passionate about software development, debugging, and problem solving
Comfortable with reading command specs and translating them into software solution
Self-motivated and eager to explore and learn new stuff 
Good knowledge in software engineering, electrical engineering or computer science.
Strong teamwork qualities as well as communication and good interpersonal skills to work effectively in a cross-functional team environment

Your Experience Includes

Have at least 3-months significant or extensive project experience in developing and debugging software or firmware in Python, C, C++, C#, or Java.

DevOps Engineer (AIR Lab),Full-time,"Singapore, Singapore",Luxoft,"Location: Singapore, Singapore

Thales people architect solutions that are relied upon to deliver operational advantage at every decisive moment throughout the mission. Defence and armed forces customers rely on us to deliver the full range of defensive systems for land, sea, and air. From early warning, to threat neutralisation, our platforms cover all levels from very short-range systems, to extended protection across the entire battle-space including Airspace Mobility Solutions, Vehicles and Tactical Systems and Missile Defence, Optronics, and Radar.

Thales established its presence in Singapore in 1973 to support the expansion of aerospace-related activities in the Asia-Pacific region. Throughout the last four decades, the company grew from strength to strength and is today involved in the primary businesses of Aerospace (including Air Traffic Management), Defence & Security, Ground Transportation and Digital Identity & Security. Thales today employs over 2,100 people in Singapore across all its business areas.

The Aviation Innovation Research (AIR) Lab

The joint CAAS-Thales innovation lab known as ‘AIR Lab’ started to operate on 1st November 2019 with the objective to develop Proof of Concepts (POCs) or Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) of advanced and open technologies for future Air Traffic Management (ATM). Currently, the joint lab employs a team of 40 Thales engineers and 12 CAAS engineers and air traffic controllers operating in a vibrant ecosystem involving a number of Singaporean SMEs and start-ups, as well as key research institutes.

Thales engineers include 10 domain experts – with more than 10 years of experience – coming from Thales ATM centres of competence in France and Australia. These experts are coaching both the local Thales and CAAS engineers.

The POCs and MVPs are co-developed with the CAAS engineers who have access to the same development tools and environment used by the Thales Engineers (provided by the Singapore branch of Thales Digital Factory). The POCs and MVPs are defined in collaboration with CAAS air traffic controllers through iterative workshops.

AIR Lab research outcomes will feed the next generation of products, including clearly disruptive outcomes addressing Safety and Security for Open architecture, data driven ATM Twin, Green Aviation, Trajectory Based Operations.

As the AIR Lab was recently extended for another 3 years, 4 work streams are now embarked:

Regional Experimental Platform, FF-ICE/TBO, Green Aviation, Future-proof Interoperable Platform-Agnostic, Safe and Secure Platforms.

AIR Lab 2.0 continues to benefit from research conducted in Europe through new architecture research which, among other objectives, aims at meeting much stricter safety standards for ground ATM systems in development by the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA). This breakthrough architecture study is co-funded by the French government (CASSIOPEA).

Regional Experimental Platform (REP) has been initiated in AIR Lab 1.0, and has the view to addressing regional needs in coordination with the SESAR 3 activities conducted in AMS France.

Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our internship program will provide an opportunity to work on meaningful products that will grow the GDP of the internet. Through the internship, you will work with many systems and technologies, gain experience in systems design and testing, and have opportunities to present your work to your team and the wider org. Each intern has a dedicated intern manager, and every project is part of the team’s roadmap and will directly help Stripe’s mission.

What you’ll do

Every internship at Stripe centers around a real, legitimate project that our customers urgently need, touching many parts of our operations and stack. We will support you in shipping it. Yes, you will actually ship it. Some recent projects include rebuilding our statistics aggregation service, building new service discovery systems, and many user facing projects like making it easy to understand error messages on Stripe Checkout. As a Stripe intern, you'll be tackling important projects to increase global commerce, while working alongside exceptional people who insist on doing their best work. You’ll learn from people with high standards who are great at inspiring others to do more and go further. We value technical and personal growth, and see our internship program as a vehicle to foster both.

Responsibilities

Write software that will be used in production, and has meaningful impact to Stripe
Give and receive technical feedback through code reviews or design discussions
Collaborate with other engineers and cross-functional stakeholders to proactively seek and incorporate feedback
Learn quickly by asking great questions, by working with your intern manager and teammates effectively, and by communicating the status of your work clearly

Some experience and familiarity with programming, either through side projects or classwork. We work mostly in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Scala, and Go. We believe new programming languages can be learned if the fundamentals and general knowledge are present
Experience from previous internships or other multi-person projects, including open source contributions, that demonstrate evaluating and receiving feedback from mentors, peers, and stakeholders
Ability to learn unfamiliar systems and form an understanding of those systems, through independent research and working with a mentor and subject matter experts

Ability to write clearly to explain your work to stakeholders, team members, and other Stripes

Hybrid work at Stripe

Our Chicago, Dublin, and Singapore teams spend at least 50% of their time in their local offices. We believe that more in-person interactions will contribute to better results for our employees and Stripe. Increased office time allows for improved collaboration, efficiency, and informal learning opportunities, fostering a stronger community and building our culture. We will apply the insights gained from these initial three locations to continue refining our hybrid approach.","Posted on Aug 24, 2023.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3730200478/?eBP=CwEAAAGK-O_oId2auw4Qn6gKo4Wj4Nm9f2Lxoj7zv6QOzZaQH-2sX-Na6JQ4AWq-L6--AnsWFuzbkoZg2COIv-w3yAFSUYtSn4VAVj4Uk-eqvOZQgJ_AktchVVCUb-xicXnw7d2uj50PGcKyGR3GPqSg7AtroM7pe687SGwtosx2Vpyze-yCqcwRwmaJkUZBLcgXR6d4YcfNsDu4UITG99p2gnQzkgzX3fyI0HHHi979qU7M-Un1DWHTD5VBVUE2kh8VuJK_XZ0sNdPQJnlIHIIz0IhphiKKzYx4wtPL6Z59t5umcCgFIyalwaw-1SBOpPhDAvQvA8pJRmREuz5rhzKVjLCa-dSyuUxiGycs2OebZZK7pNNGnTcnHBCGWVlNbQdDMpml&refId=ITwW1wC7JezO8Z1KnIDIVA%3D%3D&trackingId=zc9vISgdomcGFTDb2ZyTLA%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_search_srp_jobs
